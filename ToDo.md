# TODO

- [x] Update `cv.tex` inputs to match existing section files (`04-honors.tex`, `05-publications.tex`, `06-professionalservice.tex`, `07-credentials.tex`) so XeLaTeX can compile without missing-file errors.
- [ ] Replace placeholder bullets (`\item {}`) in `cv/02-professionalexperience.tex` with actual accomplishments or remove the empty items to avoid blank list entries.
- [x] Correct the Education entry in `cv/01-education.tex` (fix "California Statue University" to "California State University" and align the BA completion date with the career timeline).
- [x] Clean up spelling/wording issues in `cv/02-professionalexperience.tex` (e.g., "Data Coordintor", "Curriculum and Instruction Coordintor", "Collegeboard", "utilzing", "Reporting services").
- [x] Fix typos in presentation listings in `cv/03-presentations.tex` ("Excellence Though", "Leadership Institude", "resouces").
- [x] Address remaining typos and geography issues (`cv/04-honors.tex`, `cv/05-publications.tex`, `cv/06-professionalservice.tex`), such as "Educaiton", "Las Vegas, CA", and "Riverside Country".
- [x] Re-run XeLaTeX after corrections to confirm the document builds cleanly and nothing else regresses. (Current warning: FontAwesome font missing in TeX Live image.)
